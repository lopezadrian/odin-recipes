    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic dish found in Tex-Mex restaurants and beyond is easy-to-make and guilt-free. If you want a quick meal that's filling
        but light on the wallet, look no further. All you need a couple of cheap ingredients, a single pan, and plenty of tortillas.
    </p>
    <p>As a college student, fajitas were as convenient as ramen or chicken and rice, but I've found them to be not as common.
        Hopefully this simple recipe helps to convince you to try it out for yourself and add it to your repertoire.
